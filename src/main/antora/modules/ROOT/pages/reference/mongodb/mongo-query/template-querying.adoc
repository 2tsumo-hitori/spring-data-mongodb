= Methods for Querying for Documents

The query methods need to specify the target type `T` that is returned, and they are overloaded with an explicit collection name for queries that should operate on a collection other than the one indicated by the return type. The following query methods let you find one or more documents:

* *findAll*: Query for a list of objects of type `T` from the collection.
* *findOne*: Map the results of an ad-hoc query on the collection to a single instance of an object of the specified type.
* *findById*: Return an object of the given ID and target class.
* *find*: Map the results of an ad-hoc query on the collection to a `List` of the specified type.
* *findAndRemove*: Map the results of an ad-hoc query on the collection to a single instance of an object of the specified type. The first document that matches the query is returned and removed from the collection in the database.
